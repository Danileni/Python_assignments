Hey everyone.
I’m thinking of creating a wikiFeet dating app but I’m not sure how to make it appealing to women.
Here’s a new draft, slightly different direction:

Tired of dating people who are not into feet?
Got sexy feet and looking for someone to give them the attention they deserve?
Want an awesome story to tell your grandkids on how you met your significant other?
